### Please find 3 use cases in following file
#### https://github.ncsu.edu/dsuri/Austin/blob/master/Milestone2/use_case.md

## Service

  In the previous milestone, Austin-bot worked on a mock data. For this milestone, we have moved our data to an actual mongo database. The bot is using the data directly from MongoDB using REST endpoints published through an Express server.
  The python scripts are also pulling the data from these endpoints. 


## Bot Implementation

  Austin bot is created to help Agile teams conduct Scrum meetings in an asynchrounous fashion. The bot is enabled with analytics feature to provide better insights about the team performance in each sprint and overall.
