## Problem solved by Austin Bot

Scrum is one of the leading agile development methodologies used by numerous development teams worldwide. Scrum consists of the following major tasks: 
* Sprint planning, which defines work to be broken down into cycles 
* Daily stand-up meetings, which are time-boxed meetings to keep the other members of the development team updated. 
* Sprint Analytics, which enables the team to better know about past or present sprint statistics and progress.

In recent times, there has been an increase in the demand for asynchronous stand-up meetings. As the organizations have grown bigger
and spread across the globe, it is difficult for the members to set a hard timeline to conduct stand-up meetings. Another 
advantage of asynchronous meetings is that since a history is maintained, it is possible for anyone who missed a 
meeting or a new member of the team to get up to speed. However, looking at a broader picture, certain tools can be 
used to carry out analytics on the sprint data. By providing automated analytics report, it reduces the overhead 
on the scrum master and also helps to better track the progress of sprints and efficiently plan future ones.


Keeping the role analytics plays in different fields in mind, we decided to create Austin Bot, which provides a visual and 
an analytical insight into the process of sprint. The bot aims at providing the following analytics:
 * Comparison: Compare the work done in this sprint with the work done in previous sprint in terms of tasks completed, compare sprint velocity of the team, find out top performers of the team by calculating the number of tasks completed by the user, evaluate task performance by comparing what the estimated time for the task was with the actual time taken to complete the task.
 * Charts: Provide visual representation of the past and present sprint activities. These include burndown charts, user perfomance charts depicting which stories were assigned to the user and how much time the user took to complete these, velocity graph, current sprint status showing number of active stories, number of completed stories, average velocity, etc.
 * Recommendations: Provide recommendations like how to improve performance by analyzing the past incomplete stories and recommend re-allocating the hours that were assigned to the worst performer.
 
 Essentially, the bot aims at solving the problem of sprint planning. Often times, it is the case that during sprint planning, 
 we do not know how a particular member will perform the tasks, or how fast a given team completes their stories. It would be very 
 helpful for the scrum master and the product manager to have at least some insight as to how the sprint will pan out.
 
 So, in summary, Austin bot aims to leverage the power of analytics in order to gain insights from past sprints and help planning 
 the future sprints.
