### Use Case:

* **Setup Sprint:** Before the start of every sprint Product Owner will create a new channel to setup the sprint where daily status of each member will be posted. To setup the Sprint Product Owner will provide following parameters:
	* **Sprint Name:** It can be anything based on the discretion of Product Owner. Usually Sprint N format is used or Sprint <DATE> and SPRINT <PURPOSE> is used.
	* **Sprint Duration** It is the time of each sprint period which is usually 2-3 weeks depending on the team and organization.
	* **User Stories** A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement. This will be defined at the start of Sprint Planning while creating a new Sprint.
	* **Team Members** Team members include the participants in Scrum sprint which can be a part of single team working on a particular project. 

Once the user enter these details a slack channel will be created where reports of each user will be posted based on their daily work report.
